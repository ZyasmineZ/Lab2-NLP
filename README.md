# Lab2-NLP


## Part 1: Rule-Based NLP and Regex

In this part, I explored rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques and utilized regular expressions (Regex) to extract information from unstructured text data. It was fascinating to see how I could develop a Python code to generate a bill from a given text provided by the user. By applying Regex patterns, I successfully extracted product details such as quantity, unit price, and total price from the text. This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of how to preprocess and extract relevant information from textual data effectively.

## Part 2: Word Embedding

In the second part, I delved into word embedding techniques to represent text data in a numerical format. I applied various encoding techniques such as One-Hot Encoding, Bag of Words (BoW), and TF-IDF to convert text data into a structured format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I explored advanced word embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. These models allowed me to generate word embeddings that capture semantic relationships and contextual information within the text. By visualizing the encoded vectors using t-SNE algorithm, I gained insights into the effectiveness of different approaches and evaluated their performance.

## Conclusion

Throughout the lab, I gained valuable insights into the diverse techniques for processing and representing textual data. Rule-based NLP methods, such as Regex, provided me with powerful tools to extract structured information from unstructured text efficiently. On the other hand, word embedding techniques offered versatile ways to represent words in a numerical format, enabling me to capture semantic relationships and contextual information effectively. By comparing and evaluating different approaches, I learned to choose the most suitable method based on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the dataset. This hands-on experience has equipped me with valuable skills in text processing and analysis, which I can apply to various real-world applications.
